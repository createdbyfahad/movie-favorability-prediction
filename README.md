# Movie Favorability Prediction
###### Walk-through of the process of creating a model that predicts whether an upcoming movie will get an IMDB rating over 7.5

## How to run
There are two options to run the demonstration:
- Clone the repo and run it locally as Jupyter (python 3) notebook
- Or demo it in the cloud using Binder. [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/createdbyfahad/movie-favorability-prediction/master)

## About the project
The purpose of this three-part project is to use machine learning into making use of a publicly available table called IMDB 5000 titles. The main idea is to come up with a function which can predicate, with high accuracy, whether a provided movie data will have 7.5 stars or more by the user community. Decision trees and Random forests techniques will be used to determine what to use out of the two.

In Part 1: get the dataset and wrangle it by deleting unwanted data and filling missing data.
In Part 2: use couple techniques to train the prediction model
In Part 3: enhance the model performance and efficiency

Techniques used:
- Decision trees
- Random forests
- K-means clustering
- K-fold cross-validation
